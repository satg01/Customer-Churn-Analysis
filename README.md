# Churn Dynamics in Telecom: A Closer Look At Customer's
Behavior using SQL

## Overview

Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project! In this project, we delve into customer data to analyze churn patterns and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition. Understanding why customers leave and identifying factors contributing to churn are crucial for enhancing customer retention strategies.

📌 **Project Goals:**Churn Dynamics in Telecom: A Closer Look At Customer's
Behavior using SQL **.

## Project Highlights

📌 **Data Preprocessing:** Rigorously cleaned and prepared the customer churn data, ensuring data quality and integrity for accurate analysis.

📌 **SQL Queries:** Leveraged SQL queries to explore the customer churn data, perform data transformations, and extract meaningful insights.

📌 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Engaged in exploratory analysis using SQL to gain insights into customer behavior, churn distribution, and correlations between variables.

📌 **Feature Engineering:** Derived relevant metrics using SQL to enhance the analysis and uncover hidden churn factors.

📌 **Predictive Modeling:** Utilized SQL queries and statistical techniques to identify trends and patterns contributing to customer churn.

📌 **Visualization:** Utilized SQL for data visualization to create charts and graphs, presenting churn insights to stakeholders.

📌 **Actionable Recommendations:** Generated actionable recommendations to reduce churn, improve customer experience, and optimize retention strategies.

## Technologies Used

📌 **SQL:** Utilized SQL queries to perform data analysis, transformations, and insights extraction from the customer churn data.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading:** Imported and examined the customer churn dataset to understand its structure and variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed the data using SQL, handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA using SQL to explore churn patterns, visualize distributions, and identify correlations.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Engineered relevant features using SQL, such as customer tenure, usage patterns, and interaction metrics.

5. **Predictive Analysis:** Utilized SQL queries to perform predictive analysis, identifying trends and factors influencing customer churn.

6. **Visualization:** Utilized SQL for creating visualizations, enhancing data presentation for stakeholders.

7. **Insights and Recommendations:** Generated insights about churn drivers using SQL and formulated actionable recommendations for reducing churn rates.

## Project Results

The Customer Churn Analysis project provides insights into customer attrition:

📌 Identification of key factors influencing customer churn using SQL.
📌 Prediction of customer churn using insights extracted through SQL queries.
📌 Recommendations to optimize retention strategies and enhance customer experience.

To establish a robust customer base, the Telco Company should offer a straightforward and cost-effective entry to its services. During the initial six months, a concentrated effort on enhancing OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, and TechSupport is crucial. This phase is highly critical and uncertain for customers.

The company should tailor its strategies to three customer segments: SeniorCitizen, customers with partners, and those living alone.

The count of SeniorCitizen customers is limited, yet their minimum MonthlyCharges threshold surpasses that of other customer groups. This suggests that SeniorCitizen customers are willing to invest significantly, but in return, they expect top-tier services tailored to their preferences and needs.

For customers with partners as well as those living alone, to mitigate high churn rates, it’s advisable to discontinue the use of Electronic check for payments and instead prioritize Bank Transfer (automatic) and Credit Card (automatic). However, addressing the challenge of reducing the median churn tenure for these two payment methods, which currently stand above 20 months (twice that of Electronic check), will require focused efforts.

When MonthlyCharges for a single service surpass 70, customer sensitivity towards their expenses increases significantly. Therefore, it’s imperative that the Telco Company distinguishes itself through exceptional service quality. This emphasis on quality should be the company’s unique selling proposition (USP). Implementing these measures is expected to not only bolster revenue but also enhance the existing value-delivery process.
